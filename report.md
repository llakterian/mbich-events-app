# High Issues

## H-1: Sending native Eth is not protected from these functions.

Introduce checks for `msg.sender` in the function

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in contracts/EventManagement.sol [Line: 27](contracts/EventManagement.sol#L27)

	```solidity
	    function purchaseTicket(uint256 _eventId) public payable {
	```

</details>



# Low Issues

## L-1: Unsafe ERC20 Operations should not be used

ERC20 functions may not behave as expected. For example: return values are not always meaningful. It is recommended to use OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 library.

<details><summary>3 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in contracts/EventManagement.sol [Line: 45](contracts/EventManagement.sol#L45)

	```solidity
	    payable(e.organizer).transfer(e.price);
	```

- Found in contracts/EventManagement.sol [Line: 47](contracts/EventManagement.sol#L47)

	```solidity
	        payable(msg.sender).transfer(excess);
	```

- Found in contracts/Lock.sol [Line: 32](contracts/Lock.sol#L32)

	```solidity
	        owner.transfer(address(this).balance);
	```

</details>



## L-2: Solidity pragma should be specific, not wide

Consider using a specific version of Solidity in your contracts instead of a wide version. For example, instead of `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;`, use `pragma solidity 0.8.0;`

<details><summary>2 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in contracts/EventManagement.sol [Line: 2](contracts/EventManagement.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.28;
	```

- Found in contracts/Lock.sol [Line: 2](contracts/Lock.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
	```

</details>



## L-3: `public` functions not used internally could be marked `external`

Instead of marking a function as `public`, consider marking it as `external` if it is not used internally.

<details><summary>4 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in contracts/EventManagement.sol [Line: 17](contracts/EventManagement.sol#L17)

	```solidity
	    function createEvent(string memory _name, uint256 _date, uint256 _price, uint256 _ticketCount) public {
	```

- Found in contracts/EventManagement.sol [Line: 22](contracts/EventManagement.sol#L22)

	```solidity
	    function getEvent(uint256 _eventId) public view returns (string memory, uint256, uint256, uint256) {
	```

- Found in contracts/EventManagement.sol [Line: 27](contracts/EventManagement.sol#L27)

	```solidity
	    function purchaseTicket(uint256 _eventId) public payable {
	```

- Found in contracts/Lock.sol [Line: 23](contracts/Lock.sol#L23)

	```solidity
	    function withdraw() public {
	```

</details>



## L-4: Event is missing `indexed` fields

Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible to off-chain tools that parse events. However, note that each index field costs extra gas during emission, so it's not necessarily best to index the maximum allowed per event (three fields). Each event should use three indexed fields if there are three or more fields, and gas usage is not particularly of concern for the events in question. If there are fewer than three fields, all of the fields should be indexed.

- Found in contracts/EventManagement.sol [Line: 55](contracts/EventManagement.sol#L55)

	```solidity
	event TicketPurchased(uint256 indexed eventId, address indexed buyer, uint256 price);
	```

- Found in contracts/Lock.sol [Line: 11](contracts/Lock.sol#L11)

	```solidity
	    event Withdrawal(uint amount, uint when);
	```

</details>



## L-5: PUSH0 is not supported by all chains

Solc compiler version 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to Shanghai, which means that the generated bytecode will include PUSH0 opcodes. Be sure to select the appropriate EVM version in case you intend to deploy on a chain other than mainnet like L2 chains that may not support PUSH0, otherwise deployment of your contracts will fail.
